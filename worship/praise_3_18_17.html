<h2>March 18th</h2>

<h1>This is My Father's World</h1>
<p><font size="3" >1.  This is my Father's world,
<br>and to my listening ears
<br> all nature sings, and round me rings
<br>the music of the spheres.
<br>[break]
<br>This is my Father's world:
<br>I rest me in the thought
<br>of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
<br>his hand the wonders wrought.
<br>
<br>2.  This is my Father's world,
<br>the birds their carols raise,
<br>the morning light, the lily white,
<br>declare their maker's praise.
<br>[break]
<br>This is my Father's world:
<br>he shines in all that's fair;
<br>in the rustling grass I hear him pass;
<br>he speaks to me everywhere.
<br>
<br>3.  This is my Father's world.
<br>O let me ne'er forget
<br>that though the wrong seems oft so strong,
<br>God is the ruler yet.
<br>[break]
<br>This is my Father's world:
<br>why should my heart be sad?
<br>The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
<br>God reigns; let the earth be glad!
