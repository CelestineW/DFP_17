								<h2>How Great Thou Art</h2>
								<p><font size="3">

								<br>O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
								<br>Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
								<br>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
								<br>Thy power throughout the universe displayed.<br>

								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art!<br>

								<br>When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
								<br>And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
								<br>When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
								<br>And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.<br>

								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art!<br>

								<br>And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
								<br>Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
								<br>That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
								<br>He bled and died to take away my sin.<br>

								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art!<br>

								<br>When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
								<br>And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
								<br>Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
								<br>And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"<br>

								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
								<br>Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
								<br>How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
