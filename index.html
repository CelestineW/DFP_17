<h2>I Will Rise</h2>
<p><font size="3">

There's a peace I've come to know
<br>Though my heart and flesh may fail
<br>There's an anchor for my soul
<br>I can say "It is well"
<br>
<br>Jesus has overcome
<br>And the grave is overwhelmed
<br>The victory is won
<br>He is risen from the dead
<br>And I will rise when He calls my name
<br>No more sorrow, no more pain
<br>I will rise on eagles' wings
<br>Before my God fall on my knees
<br>And rise
<br>I will rise
<br>
<br>There's a day that's drawing near
<br>When this darkness breaks to light
<br>And the shadows disappear
<br>And my faith shall be my eyes
<br>
<br>Jesus has overcome
<br>And the grave is overwhelmed
<br>The victory is won
<br>He is risen from the dead
<br>And I will rise when He calls my name
<br>No more sorrow, no more pain
<br>I will rise on eagles' wings
<br>Before my God fall on my knees
<br>And rise
<br>I will rise
<br>
<br>And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>
<br>And I will rise when He calls my name
<br>No more sorrow, no more pain
<br>I will rise on eagles' wings
<br>Before my God fall on my knees
<br>And rise
<br>I will rise

<h2>You Never Let Go</h2>
<p><font size="3" >
Even though I walk through the valley
<br>of the shadow of death
<br>Your perfect love is casting out fear
<br>And even when I'm caught in the middle
<br>of the storms of this life
<br>I won't turn back
<br>I know you are near
<br>
<br>And I will fear no evil
<br>For my God is with me
<br>And if my God is with me
<br>Whom then shall I fear?
<br>Whom then shall I fear?
<br>
<br>Oh no, You never let go
<br>Through the calm and through the storm
<br>Oh no, You never let go
<br>In every high and every low
<br>Oh no, You never let go
<br>Lord, You never let go of me
<br>
<br>And I can see a light that is coming
<br>for the heart that holds on
<br>A glorious light beyond all compare
<br>And there will be an end to these troubles
<br>But until that day comes
<br>We'll live to know You here on the earth
<br>
<br>Oh no, You never let go
<br>Through the calm and through the storm
<br>Oh no, You never let go
<br>In every high and every low
<br>Oh no, You never let go
<br>Lord, You never let go of me
<br>
<br>Yes, I can see a light that is coming
<br>for the heart that holds on
<br>And there will be an end to these troubles
<br>But until that day comes
<br>Still I will praise You, still I will praise You

<h2>Good Good Father</h2>
<p><font size="3" >

I've heard a thousand stories
<br>of what they think you're like
<br>But I've heard the tender whispers
<br>of love in the dead of night
<br>And you tell me that you're pleased
<br>And that I'm never alone
<br>
<br>You're a good good father
<br>It's who you are, it's who you are,
<br>it's who you are
<br>And I'm loved by you
<br>It's who I am, it's who I am,
<br>it's who I am
<br>
<br>I've seen many searching
<br>For answers far and wide
<br>But I know we're all searching
<br>For answers only you provide
<br>'Cause you know just what we need
<br>Before we say a word
<br>
<br>You're a good good father
<br>It's who you are, it's who you are,
<br>it's who you are
<br>And I'm loved by you
<br>It's who I am, it's who I am,
<br>it's who I am
<br>
<br>Because you are perfect in all of your ways
<br>You are perfect in all of your ways
<br>You are perfect in all of your ways to us
<br>(x2)
<br>
<br>Oh, love so undeniable
<br>I, I can hardly speak
<br>Peace so unexplainable
<br>I, I can hardly think
<br>As you call me deeper still
<br>As you call me deeper still
<br>As you call me deeper still
<br>Into love, love, love
<br>
<br>You're a good good father
<br>It's who you are, it's who you are,
<br>it's who you are
<br>And I'm loved by you
<br>It's who I am, it's who I am,
<br>it's who I am
