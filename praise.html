<h2>April 15th</h2>

<h1>I Will Rise</h1>
<p><font size="3" >

<br>There's a peace I've come to know
<br>Though my heart and flesh may fail
<br>There's an anchor for my soul
<br>I can say "It is well"
<br>Jesus has overcome
<br>And the grave is overwhelmed
<br>The victory is won
<br>He is risen from the dead
<br>And I will rise when He calls my name
<br>No more sorrow, no more pain
<br>I will rise on eagles' wings
<br>Before my God fall on my knees
<br>And rise
<br>I will rise
<br>There's a day that's drawing near
<br>When this darkness breaks to light
<br>And the shadows disappear
<br>And my faith shall be my eyes
<br>Jesus has overcome
<br>And the grave is overwhelmed
<br>The victory is won
<br>He is risen from the dead
<br>And I will rise when He calls my name
<br>No more sorrow, no more pain
<br>I will rise on eagles' wings
<br>Before my God fall on my knees
<br>And rise
<br>I will rise
<br>And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
<br>"Worthy is the Lamb"
<br>And I will rise when He calls my name
<br>No more sorrow, no more pain
<br>I will rise on eagles' wings
<br>Before my God fall on my knees
<br>And rise
<br>I will rise
