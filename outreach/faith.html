								<h4>We Believe...</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired Word of God, without error in the original writings; the complete revelation of His will for the salvation of man; and the Divine and final authority for Christian faith and life. (Psalm 119:89; John 12:47-48; II Tim. 3:16-17; II Peter 1:21; Rev. 22:18-19).
									</li><br>
									<li>In one God, who is the Creator of man and all things, absolutely perfect and eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Gen. 1:1; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 44:6; Matt. 28:19; II Cor. 13:14).
									</li><br>
									<li>That Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He was crucified for our iniquities, was buried, on the third day arose bodily from the dead, and ascended into heaven. He is now our High Priest and Advocate at the right hand of the most high God. (Matt. 1:18, 22-23; John 1:1-14; Rom. 1:2-4; I Cor. 15:1-4; Heb. 7:22-25, 8:1; I John 2:1).
									</li><br>
									<li>That the Holy Spirit is equal in substance and glory with God the Father and the Son. That the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, and during this age to convict man, regenerate sinners, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower believers for godly living and service. (John 14:16,26, 16:7-14; Rom. 8:9-16,26,27; I John 2:27).
									</li><br>
									<li>That man was created in the image of God, but fell into sin and is therefore lost and can obtain salvation and spiritual life only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Gen. 1:27; John 3:5,7; Rom. 1:18, 3:23, 5:12, 18-19).
									</li><br>
									<li>That salvation is by grace alone, through faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and was raised according to the Scriptures. Those who thus receive Jesus Christ by faith have their sins forgiven and their consciences cleansed, are born of the Spirit, become children of God, are made a new creation in Christ, and are reconciled to God. (John 1:12-13, 3:5,6,8; Rom. 3:25; I Cor. 15:3-4; II Cor. 5:17,20; Eph. 1:7, 2:8-9; Heb. 9:14; I John 1:9).
									</li><br>
									<li>That water baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances to be observed by the Church during the present age as testimonies before God and man. (Matt. 28:18-19; Rom. 6:1-4; I Cor. 11:23-26).
									</li><br>
									<li>That the Universal Church is composed of all such persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ have been regenerated by theHoly Spirit and have been united together in the Body of Christ of which He is the Head; and that a local church is to reflect the truth of the Universal Church, particularly in the areas of unity, service, witnessing, and discipleship. (I Cor. 12:13; Eph. 1:23, 2:11-22, 4:1-6).
									</li><br>
									<li>In the certain return of our Lord Jesus Christ in person, and that this "Blessed Hope" has a vital bearing on the personal life and service of the believer. (I Cor. 15:52-58; Titus 2:11-13; I John 3:2-3).
									</li><br>
									<li>In the bodily resurrection of the dead, of believers to everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord, of unbelievers to judgment and everlasting conscious punishment. (Matt. 25:31-46; John 5:29; I Cor. 15:35-49; Rev. 20:15).
									</li><br>
									<li>That the government of the local church is under the Headship of Jesus Christ and is to be guided by the Holy Spirit based on the Scriptures for the glory of God. (I Cor. 11:3, 12:4-6; Col. 1:18).
									</li><br>
									<li>That a Christian who is born of the Holy Spirit is to live the new life by the power of the Holy Spirit; and that it is his responsibility to yield himself to God, to trust and to live in Him. (John 10:28-29; Rom. 6:13; Gal. 5:16-25; Col. 2:6).
									</li><br>
									<li>That Christian living includes Christian service; the winning of souls around us; and the preaching of the Gospel unto the uttermost parts of the world. To carry out these ministries, the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit is needed. This power is granted to every believer as he yields to and trusts in God. Prayer is, therefore, most important among all services. (Matt. 28:18-20; John 14:12-14; Acts 1:8, 5:32; I Cor. 12:7; Eph. 3:20, 6:18-19).
									</li><br>
									<li>That marriage is a sacred covenant between one man and one woman established by God for a lifetime. Marriage is a gift from God for the purpose of companionship, mutual intimacy, procreation, and representing Christâ€™s love for his church. (Ephesians 5:22-28; 1 Corinthians 7:2-4; Genesis 1:27-28, 2:18-25).</li><br>
